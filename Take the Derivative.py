"""This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent.

Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to print out an expression (like 28x^7). "^1" should not be truncated when exponent = 2.

In this case, the function should multiply 7 and 8, and then subtract 1 from 8. It should output "56x^7", the first number 56 being the product of the two numbers, and the second number being the exponent minus 1."""
